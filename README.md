# MOSA Hackathon Project
Hi! Welcome to our project for the MOSA Hackathon. 

## Important items to note: 
  - The source code is written in Java, using SDK 1.8 and Java SE 7
  - The project uses external libraries, which are included in the .idea folder, as well as the .libs folder 
  - The libraries are the twilio library used for sending text messages (library built done with Maven) and the google JSON library for     reading and parsing JSON into a Java HashMap
  - You will need all of the external libraries to properly run the project. 
  
## How to run the project 
  - Clone the repository, and ensure that you have registered on https://openweathermap.org/ to get your API key, which is used in the RetrieveWeather.java file.
